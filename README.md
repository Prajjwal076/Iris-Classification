# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using KNN

This project is part of my virtual internship at **CODSOFT**.  
The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species using petal and sepal measurements, powered by the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

## 📁 Task Overview

- ✅ Dataset: [Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
- 📐 Features used: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- 🧠 Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (K=3)
- 🎯 Goal: Predict the flower species: `setosa`, `versicolor`, or `virginica`

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Loading and exploring datasets with `pandas`
- Creating visualizations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Preprocessing and splitting data using `train_test_split`
- Training and evaluating a basic machine learning model with `scikit-learn`
- Interpreting performance with confusion matrix and classification report
- ✨ Added custom input prediction to simulate real-world model usage

## 📊 Model Performance

- Final test accuracy: **~97%**
- The model performs best in distinguishing **setosa**, while **versicolor** and **virginica** show slight overlap
