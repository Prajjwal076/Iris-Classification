# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project is part of my virtual internship at **CODSOFT**.  
The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species using machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbors).

## 📁 Task Overview
- Use sepal and petal measurements to predict the flower species.
- Dataset: [Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
- Model Used: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to load and explore data using `pandas`
- How to visualize features with `seaborn`
- How to train a basic ML model using `scikit-learn`
- How to evaluate a model using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Model Accuracy
- Final accuracy on test data: **~97%**

## 📷 Sample Visualization
*(Add a screenshot here if you want)*

## 📌 How to Run
1. Download the notebook
2. Open in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells
